This code is a simple clock program that displays the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. 
The program allows the user to add one hour, one minute, or one second to the clock by selecting from a menu.

The program uses the time() and localtime() functions to get the current time from the system and split it into hours, minutes, and seconds.
